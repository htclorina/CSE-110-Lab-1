## About Me
I was first introduced to computer science in my sophomore year in high school, and have been interested in the field ever since.
I have experience programming with `Java`, `C++`, `Python`, and `C`.
I am a third year undergraduate student at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science.
I am a student in Professor Powell's CSE 110 class.
In this class, I hope to:
- [ ] Better my understanding of software engineering.
- [ ] Improve programming and social skills as I acquaint myself with the group.
- [ ] Gain skills and insight to prepare for my future career.

## Hobbies and Interests

### Video Making
My first video was for a science project in middle school, since then I began creating skits and small projects for fun. I also enjoy video editing, from creating memes to helping with stream highlights.

### Basketball
I enjoy both watching basketball and casually playing the sport. I am a very avid Lakers fan and have been following the team since the 04-05 season. It was during this season where we saw Kobe Bryant score [81 points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeXZY4eVLlo&ab_channel=NBA) against the Toronto Raptors.
### Music
I very much enjoy listening to classic chiptune tracks, and over the pandemic, I wanted to try to create some of my own. Inspired by [Tim Folin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGNSHNf-nlU&list=PLIeoKuc27VXUseoN9-6VGIQKps457EkpQ&index=5&ab_channel=explod2A03), I downloaded [FamiTracker](http://famitracker.com/) in an attempt to compose my own tracks despite **not** having any knowledge of music composition.
